Now  I  discovered  Pairing  only  happens  when there  is  an Exixting  mature  Order, 

eg  when a buyer  makes  Purchase  , and already there  was  a matured sellers  order  then the  pairing  flow will happen ,  but  when an Order  was  made  and  there  was no matured  order  at  that  time  , then a few  minutes  later  a matured order  comes ,  then that  order that  was made earlier on  wont  pair with this  new   matured order  ,  I  am trying  not  to  edit  allot  of  things  
This  buytap_pair_buyer_with_seller($order_id);  is  only  called during order creation I  need a reverse logic when a seller matures  please  dont  complicate  things  If  a I  can just  add that  logic safely  I'd  Appreciate
